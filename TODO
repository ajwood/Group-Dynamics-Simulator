- Make my own botton image (current versions borrowed from http://www.pygame.org/project-Life+as+a+Bit-2064-.html)

- Critical mass needs better implementation. Current problem is that many boxes come out of it with the same velocity 

- realistic gravity, or at least different gravity schemes

- maybe give different sized boxes with different mass

- Optimization
	- Long tails probably shouldn't have to be redrawn every time. Only erase the last and draw the first box in the tail list
	- The numpy arrays are probably overkill -- can things speed up if they're float tupples?

- Add supprt to draw acceleration and/or velocity vectors
